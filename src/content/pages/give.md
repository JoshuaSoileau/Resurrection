      # Why Give?


      We give our resources to the local body of Christ primarily to express gratitude and trust in our generous God who has freely given us all things, first and foremost his grace. In the words of Paul, “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich" (2 Corinthians 8:9).


      A healthy church requires generosity from each one who calls it home in order to operate and fulfill it's mission.


      Why share what we've been given? The words of Jesus beautifully summarize: "Freely you have received; freely give" (Matthew 10:8).

      # Ways to Give


      ***Online:***


      We offer electronic giving as a way for our community to give at anytime and to automate the important. You may make a one-time gift, or you can easily set up your recurring tithe if you wish.


      ***Sundays:***


      As part of our Sunday liturgy, we have a time of offering every week where we express our gratitude by giving our lives and our resources to God. We give financially, but this part of our service is a deeper call to offer our entire lives to God with thanksgiving.


      ***Mail:*** 


      You may also mail checks made payable to "Resurrection Anglican Church" to:

      ## What does my giving support?


      It takes financial resources to accomplish the work God has called us to do for our community, our city, and the world. Your faithful giving helps support the spiritual formation of our community and the spread of the gospel. It supports mission initiatives in our city and around the world. It allows us to maintain a space for friends, family, and neighbors to gather, as well as worship together.


      *General Fund*


      This is our main operating fund and is used for the day-to-day operations of our church. These funds may also be allocated by our Vestry to the other funds listed below as needed and when possible.


      *Pastor Discretionary Fund*


      This fund is available to our pastor to help members of our congregation or residents of our neighborhood who may be in crisis and need some moderate financial assistance. The use of the funds are at the discretion of Bill Scott, our Rector, as he and the leadership identify individuals who are in significant need.


      *Building Fund*


      We are a church plant and one of our many prayer requests to God is that our growth would lead to a future permanent home for Resurrection Anglican Church. The balance of this fund would allow us to one day in our future acquire a space that can be used for God's glory here in Rock Hill as we continue to share his love with this wonderful city.


      *Mission Fund*


      We take pride in making sure that we support both local and international missions initiatives. Giving to this fund ensures that we continue to support outreach initiatives within our city of Rock Hill as well as assisting other missions partners globally.
