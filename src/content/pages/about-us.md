      # Our mission


      We believe that God’s rescue plan is extravagant. Jesus’ life, death and resurrection saves us from our sins and allows us to be in relationship with the Triune God. Salvation brings the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, uniting us to Jesus Christ and sealing us as sons and daughters of the Father. We gather on Sundays to corporately praise Father, Son and Spirit, lifting up our voices and hearts in celebration. But we also gather to prepare us participate in God’s Mission. Basking in the love that is the Trinity, growing in relationship with God and Church, prepares us, fills us, gifts us with the stamina, the desire, the clarity on how to rightly engage the larger community, taking the light into the darkness, showing the world God’s extravagant love.

      We invite ALL people to experience God’s presence by receiving the LOVE of
      the Father, living in the GRACE of Jesus, and surrendering to the POWER of
      the Spirit. God will accomplish this through our mission.


      ## Experience the Trinity


      Passionately creating an atmosphere where a genuine culture of God-honoring, Christ-centered, Spirit-filled, biblical worship is established for Sundays and drives us to engage in worship throughout the week in personal, family and small group settings. 


      *Scripture references: Matt. 22:37, John 4:23-24, Psalm 63:1-8, 95-96, 100, Rev. 7:9-12, Isaiah 1:1-20, Micah 6:8, Romans 12:1-2*.


      ## Embracing Community


      Intentionally building an authentic community of hospitality and grace where all people are made to feel welcome so that they may hear, experience, and respond to Jesus Christ and grow in relationship with God and Church. 


      *Scripture references: Genesis 1:26-27, Romans 5, Ephesians 4:1-6, John 3:3-17, Galatians 3:28, 1 Peter 4:7-9, Luke 14:12-14, Hebrews 13:1-2, 1 John 4:19-21*


      ## Engage the City


      Joyfully giving our time, our talents, and our treasures in a way that honors and celebrates the goodness of God, serves others, and inspires people to want to know God more. 


      *Scripture references: Exodus 36:1-7, Matt. 28:18-20, Acts 1:8, Matt. 5:14-16, 1 Cor. 12, Romans 12, Ephesians 4, Rev. 4:9-11*

      # O﻿ur music


      Musically, the worship service will be blended with both old and new (a fancy term would be “ancient-future”). We will sing hymns regularly but also the most recent worship songs.


      O﻿ur worship leaders curate our songs to fit the season and best instill the holy spirit in our congregation.

      # Join the community




      The very best way to feel the fellowship that makes our church so special is to make connections with other church members and get to know us a little bit better!


      Our church family communicates through email (which you can join above), and in one giant GroupMe chat group. We use this group to share announcements, reminders for church events, prayer requests, and family updates.


      If you'd like to join this GroupMe group, send an email to admin@resurrectionrockhill.org with your name, email, and phone number, and we'll send you an invitation.
