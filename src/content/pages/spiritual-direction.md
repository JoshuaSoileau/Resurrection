      \*\*Beautiful quote here\*\*


      Resurrection Anglican Church is very excited to begin to offer Spiritual Direction as one of the ministries of the church.


      What is Spiritual Direction? 


      \- time together talking (mostly the directee) and listening (both persons). Silence. Prayer. Questions. Answers. Tears. Laughing. 




      What it isn’t - therapy. Pastoral counseling. Receiving advice or commands. 




      Cost - absolutely nothing. We want to walk with anyone who has a desire to grow in their relationship with God or to learn to quiet themselves to hear the Spirit. But if you would like to donate to ensure that we can continue to do this much needed ministry.
