      # Do you know what Lent means?


      Etymology (the study of the meaning and use of a word) is like chasing a rabbit down a series of burrows and tunneling in every direction possible in hope of getting to it’s foundational meaning. You trust that whoever did the tedious work of researching root words and declensions over centuries of multiple languages had some clear direction and determination to their work. But defining the meaning of a word does appear to have some aimlessness to it and requires a bit of patience and wonder in the process.


      I do not claim to be an etymologist or even an English major… but I do like words. When I started looking at the origins of Lent and what the word actually means I was amazed at how it came into existence, what it points to in scripture and Church history, and it’s implications for life with the Spirit today. Lent comes from an Old English word, Lenten, that was used around the 14th century in Western Europe. If you look it up, most dictionaries will tell you it means “to lengthen”. The suggestion is that these are the spring days from late-February to early April that tend to lengthen as we get closer to summer. The root word for day in Latin comes from a Slavic word- Dini or Deyu; which means “to shine”. 


      Like most religious practices that emerged throughout the dark ages in Europe, I get a strong sense that there are some unhealthy religious underpinnings to why Lent was enforced on saints and sinners alike. The traditional season of Lent follows Epiphany in the church calendar and lasts around forty days to harken the forty days of fasting that Jesus experienced in the desert. The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer for Holy Week, with it’s pinnacle in the resurrection of Jesus.  Through prayer, acts of penance, repentance of sins, giving of time, talent, and finaces, and the denial of self and pleasure, believers from all over the world enter into a season of preparation and anticipation. But why are these acts or actions important for preparing us for the resurrection of Jesus?


      I’m not against fasting, prayer, giving, or repentance… these are all part of the daily discipline and practices of being a Christ-follower. But what makes this season of Lent so significant? Unlike so many other holidays, Lent is not about consumption, self-absorption, and commercialism. It’s about doing less, removing the clutter, and changing some patterns and habits in our lives. It is unpopular, unmarketable and quite honestly it’s inconvenient. There is a natural reluctance to such disciplines because they are quite honestly… hard to do.  So what is gained as we choose in obedience to have a few weeks where we do less, eat and drink less, and spend more time in concentration and meditation on the person of Jesus? 


      We are “peculiar people”. We march to the beat of a different drum… His drum. And by entering into a different daily and weekly rhythm, we align ourselves to God’s way of living and learning so that we can better understand who He is, how He made us and what this abiding life with Him really looks like. Forty is Biblically important for a lot of reasons. It represents a time of trial or hardship. We see this in narratives such as Noah and the flood, the Hebrews’ journey in the wilderness, Moses on Mt. Sinai and of course Jesus in the desert. There are not set rules to what we choose to do during these Lenten days but I believe and have witnessed personally that when we choose to participate in these ancient rhythms something tremendous happens. We begin to declutter the busyness of our lives, recalibrate and find a deeper sense of joy and peace. These Long Days to Shine is an invitation to each of us to partake in the paradox of momentary suffering that brings about a richer vitality in our relationship with God.
