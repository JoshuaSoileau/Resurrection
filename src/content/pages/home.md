      # Children's Ministry


      Children are a big part of Resurrection. They currently make up a *third* of our congregation!


      We offer nursery and children’s church where there are age-appropriate lessons and activities for preschool-5th grade. This takes place during the scripture reading and sermon. 




      They do participate with the rest of us during the other parts of the service, particularly communion. We feel this is a good balance to keep them active and engaged, assisting in their spiritual formation, as well as giving their parents an opportunity to worship.

      # T﻿he Anglican Way




      We are an Anglican congregation. We follow a flow of worship known as "liturgical" but we like to say our worship is birthed from Scripture and also draws from some of the earliest forms of worship as the Church was growing. 


      We gather on Sundays to *Experience the Trinity*, which is the catalyst that enables us, along with other opportunities during the week, to grow as the church and *Embody Community*, and allows us to be unified in the goal of taking the light into the darkness and *Engage the City*.

      # Join the community




      The very best way to feel the fellowship that makes our church so special is to make connections with other church members and get to know us a little bit better!


      Our church family communicates through email (which you can join above), and in one giant GroupMe chat group. We use this group to share announcements, reminders for church events, prayer requests, and family updates.


      If you'd like to join this GroupMe group, send an email to admin@resurrectionrockhill.org with your name, email, and phone number, and we'll send you an invitation.
