      ## Alpha has begun!


      Are you curious? Perhaps skeptical? Or maybe you are just seeking some answers to life’s deeper questions. If those resonate with you at all…


      Alpha is for you.


      Alpha is a series of gatherings that explore the Christian faith. In a no-pressure, judgment-free space, people can explore their thoughts together.


      Many join for different reasons, with different backgrounds and points of view, but all are seeking to find whether Jesus and Christianity have any relevance for their life.


      ## What Happens at Alpha?


      Each week follows the same pattern. A fun, informal time of fellowship around a delicious meal, a talk highlighting an important part of Christian thinking, followed by honest small group discussion.


      You will find yourself not only learning from the presentation but also realize that you are building genuine relationships through engaging in open dialog with your group. We love to say that Alpha is all about relationships. And to us, that’s a really good thing!


      ## Questions of Life


      Questions pondered at Alpha:


      * What is the meaning of life?

      * Who was Jesus really?

      * Resurrection? Really?

      * What’s the big deal about the Bible?

      * Does God really heal?

      * Does believing in God make any real difference?


      These and many more will come up throughout the Alpha course.

      # Children's Ministry


      Children are a big part of Resurrection. They currently make up a *third* of our congregation!


      We offer nursery and children’s church where there are age-appropriate lessons and activities for preschool-5th grade. This takes place during the scripture reading and sermon.




      They do participate with the rest of us during the other parts of the service, particularly communion. We feel this is a good balance to keep them active and engaged, assisting in their spiritual formation, as well as giving their parents an opportunity to worship.

      # T﻿he Anglican Way


      We are an Anglican congregation. We follow a “liturgical” worship service which is spirit-led and birthed from Scripture and some of the origins of Christian worship as the Church was growing.


      We gather on Sundays to *Experience the Trinity*, which is the catalyst that enables us, along with other opportunities during the week, to grow as the church and *Embody Community*, and allows us to be unified in the goal of taking the light into the darkness and *Engage the City*.

      # Join the community




      The very best way to feel the fellowship that makes our church so special is to make connections with other church members and get to know us a little bit better!


      Our church family communicates through email (which you can join above), and in one giant GroupMe chat group. We use this group to share announcements, reminders for church events, prayer requests, and family updates.


      If you'd like to join this GroupMe group, send an email to admin@resurrectionrockhill.org with your name, email, and phone number, and we'll send you an invitation.
