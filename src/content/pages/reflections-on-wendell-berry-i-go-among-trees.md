      I was an undiagnosed ADHD child that had real problems sitting still. Even as an adult, I still have an overactive brain and it's difficult to sit and be quiet. It is difficult to turn off all the requests, the projects, the to-do lists, the questioning of self and of others, and let those demands of life "lie in their places… like sleeping cattle." Berry explains that like our Savior, we must be deliberate about finding the still and quiet moments- they won't just naturally fall in our laps.

      Countless times in the Gospels, we find Jesus, slipping away into the wilderness, away from the crowds and his disciples to simply pray and be still. As we practice stillness and meditative prayer in this Lenten season it harkens back to the forty days that Jesus spent in the wilderness before his public ministry began. Being alone is scary. Being alone in the wilderness for forty days with wild animals is a really scary thought.

      In my younger years, I braved the wilderness as an avid section hiker on the Appalachian Trail. I never traveled alone but I have hiked and camped in the woods for fourteen days before. Living with just the items on your back, often going several days without seeing a road or any sign of civilization changes a person. I remember during one of those section hikes, the rain pouring down on us as it often did, I realized that my mind had slowed down and I wasn't "spinning the plates" of tasks, jobs, and worrisome thoughts anymore. My soul was satisfied with being still in his creation. Doing the simple, redundant, and beautiful repetition of walking one foot in front of the other until we called it a day, and then rested in our tiny tents. My stirring had become quiet on those trips.

      Fear is defined as a strong emotion that is unpleasant, and even painful. Fear is often experienced alongside loneliness, isolation, and depression. We know from Genesis 3:10 and 4:14 that fear is a byproduct of sin entering the world through man's disobedience. Fear is not a natural emotion that God ever intended for us to know. In these lines, Berry is describing something that is both afraid of him and he is afraid of it.

      When we spend time alone, in solitude, sometimes our scariest thoughts rear their ugly heads and stare us down, like a wild animal dangerously hidden just inside the woodline. Our fear is whether these thoughts are a real threat. We ask ourselves if they are real and can truly hurt us. They draw questions about our identity, our purpose, our value and they most certainly challenge the authority and word of God. But what Berry is urging us to believe in these solemn moments, when we face our fears, is to release the grip that it holds on us and deny giving it a shred of our faith and refuse to be held hostage by them anymore.

      Franklin D. Roosevelt was quoted saying, "Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear." That something that is more important is the Triune God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and the unbreakable bond of love we have with him. When we set our thoughts and hearts on him and the promises he has spoken over our lives, we divert from fear and can sing with joy the words of Isaiah:

      "So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
      I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand (Isaiah 41:10)."

      The final section of Wendell Berry's poem highlights two distinct features that are characteristic of the season of Lent. The first is the line, "mute in my consternations". Mute- unable to speak. How many of us have walked through seasons where we feel mute? Times when we have called out to God for help, for an answer, for direction or a decision but our words were not heard. A feeling that we've been cut-off from God and we don't even know what to say anymore or how to pray. This soundless reality seems endless at times and yet, God is faithful to bring us a song… at last.

      The second line that I love is, "the day turns, the trees move". In these Lenten "lengthening" days, nature moves from dormant and quiet, mute, and bare; and slowly the Earth moves, the ground quivers, the trees begin to shake and new life springs forth. We witness these physical changes as each day "turns" and inches its way towards Spring but what are the spiritual transformations happening in our own lives? What lies dormant in our hearts right now that longs to hear the Father's song at last?

      As we seek him in these quiet days and nights of Lent, let us be deliberate in our stillness. Let's be obstinate to find our quiet places. May we, like Christ, slip away in the night to rest in his peace as the concentric circles of our dissipating grief vanish and the grip of fear is released to the sound of singing.
