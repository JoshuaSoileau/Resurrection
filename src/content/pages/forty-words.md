      # Join the community

      The very best way to feel the fellowship that makes our church so special is to make connections with other church members and get to know us a little bit better!

      Our church family communicates through email (which you can join above), and in one giant GroupMe chat group. We use this group to share announcements, reminders for church events, prayer requests, and family updates.

      If you'd like to join this GroupMe group, send an email to admin@resurrectionrockhill.org with your name, email, and phone number, and we'll send you an invitation.
